# Install OpenClaw

```bash
npm install -g openclaw@latest
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

## Configure AI Backends

Select your AI backend during onboard. For Google, choose **Google Antigravity**.

## Gateway

Set up [Telegram](telegram.md) as the messaging gateway.

## Skills

Select skills according to your needs. Some skills require their own API keys:

- [Google Places](google_ai_plan.md)
- [Nano Banana](google_ai_plan.md)
- [Notion API](https://www.notion.com/my-integrations)

## Web UI Token

Pay attention to the web UI token displayed at the end of the installation process — it is different from the Telegram bot token.
