# Biblemate (MCP)

Bible study MCP server with 48 tools. Use `mcporter call biblemate.<tool>` for all Bible-related queries.

## Workflow: Structured Bible Study

When a user asks a Bible-related question, **DO NOT** answer directly. Follow this structured approach:

---

### Step 1: Refine the Request (Prompt Engineering)

Before planning, **improve the user's request** to ensure optimal results from the tools. Apply prompt engineering principles:

#### 1.1 Identify Issues in the Original Request

Check for:
- **Ambiguities:** Words with multiple meanings (e.g., "love" — agape, phileo, eros?)
- **Vague scope:** "Tell me about Paul" (which aspect? theology? biography? letters?)
- **Missing context:** No time period, testament, or theological tradition specified
- **Unclear intent:** Study purpose not stated (academic, devotional, sermon prep?)
- **Assumed knowledge:** References that need clarification (e.g., "the passage about the armor")
- **Imprecise references:** Partial or incorrect verse citations

#### 1.2 Refinement Techniques

Apply these strategies:

| Technique | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Specify scope** | Narrow broad topics to specific aspects | "grace" → "grace in Pauline epistles, specifically Ephesians 2:1-10" |
| **Clarify intent** | State the study purpose | Add: "for devotional reflection" or "for exegetical analysis" |
| **Add context** | Include relevant background | "faith" → "faith (πίστις/pistis) in Hebrews 11, examining OT examples" |
| **Define terms** | Clarify key concepts | "salvation" → "salvation as justification, sanctification, and glorification" |
| **Specify output** | Request particular deliverables | Add: "including cross-references and practical applications" |
| **Bound the search** | Limit testament, genre, or author | "prophecy" → "messianic prophecy in Isaiah 7-12" |
| **Resolve references** | Convert vague to precise | "that famous verse about love" → "1 Corinthians 13:4-7" |

#### 1.3 Output the Refined Request

Present the refinement in this format:

```
## Request Refinement

**Original Request:** [User's exact words]

**Issues Identified:**
- [Issue 1]: [Brief explanation]
- [Issue 2]: [Brief explanation]

**Refinements Applied:**
- [Technique used]: [How it improves the request]
- [Technique used]: [How it improves the request]

**Refined Request:** [Clear, specific, well-structured version]

**Assumed Parameters:**
- Study type: [exegetical | devotional | theological | historical | topical]
- Depth: [overview | moderate | deep-dive]
- Output focus: [academic | practical | both]
```

#### 1.4 Refinement Examples

**Example 1: Vague Topic**
- Original: "Tell me about faith"
- Issues: Too broad, no scope, unclear intent
- Refined: "Examine the concept of faith (πίστις) in Hebrews 11, analyzing how the author defines faith in v.1, the OT examples cited, and how this understanding applies to perseverance in trials. Include Greek word study and cross-references to James 2."

**Example 2: Unclear Reference**
- Original: "What's the verse about God's plans?"
- Issues: Ambiguous reference (multiple candidates), no context
- Refined: "Retrieve and analyze Jeremiah 29:11 ('For I know the plans I have for you'), examining its original context (exile in Babylon), proper interpretation (corporate vs. individual promise), and appropriate modern application."

**Example 3: Broad Character Study**
- Original: "Tell me about David"
- Issues: Massive topic, no focus area
- Refined: "Conduct a character study of David focusing on his spiritual journey through failure and restoration, specifically examining Psalm 51 in light of 2 Samuel 11-12, including the theological themes of repentance, forgiveness, and consequences of sin."

**Example 4: Simple Verse Request (Minimal Refinement)**
- Original: "What does John 3:16 mean?"
- Issues: None significant, but can add depth
- Refined: "Provide exegetical analysis of John 3:16, including the Greek terms (κόσμος, μονογενής, πιστεύων), the immediate context of Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus, theological significance of substitutionary love, and connection to John's broader 'believe' theme."

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Refined Request

With the refined request, identify:
- The core question or topic
- Type of study needed (exegesis, devotional, theological, historical, practical)
- Relevant Bible passages, characters, or themes
- User's apparent level (casual reader, student, scholar)
- Required depth and output format

---

### Step 3: Create Preliminary Action Plan

Output a plan in this format:

```
# Preliminary Action Plan

**Refined Request:** [The improved version from Step 1]
**Study Type:** [exegetical | devotional | theological | historical | topical | character | comparative]
**Depth:** [overview | moderate | deep-dive]

## Complete Example Workflow

**User asks:** "What does it mean to be 'born again' in John 3?"

---

### Step 1: Request Refinement

**Original Request:** "What does it mean to be 'born again' in John 3?"

**Issues Identified:**
- Scope slightly vague: Which verses specifically? (John 3 has 36 verses)
- Depth unclear: Surface explanation or deep exegesis?
- Missing: No mention of Greek analysis (critical for "born again" ambiguity)

**Refinements Applied:**
- Specify scope: Focus on John 3:1-8 (the Nicodemus dialogue)
- Add linguistic depth: Include Greek analysis of ἄνωθεν (anōthen)
- Clarify theological dimension: Connect to regeneration doctrine
- Add practical element: Modern application for believers

**Refined Request:** "Provide exegetical analysis of 'born again' (γεννηθῇ ἄνωθεν) in John 3:1-8, examining: (1) the Greek double-meaning of ἄνωθεν (again/from above), (2) Jesus' explanation of water and Spirit birth, (3) why Nicodemus as a Pharisee should have understood this from OT background, (4) the theological doctrine of regeneration, and (5) practical implications for understanding conversion today."

**Assumed Parameters:**

   - Input: "John 3:3-7 focusing on the Greek word ἄνωθεν and its double meaning"

3. **Cross-References**
   - Tool: `biblemate.retrieve_bible_cross_references`
   - Purpose: Find OT background and NT parallels on spiritual rebirth

## Measurable Outcomes

- [ ] Greek meaning of ἄνωθεν (anōthen) — "again" vs "from above" — clarified
- [ ] Water and Spirit birth relationship explained (baptism? Ezekiel 36? amniotic?)
- [ ] OT background identified (Ezek 36:25-27, Jer 31:33, etc.)
- [ ] Theological doctrine of regeneration summarized
- [ ] Practical application for understanding conversion provided

---

[Then execute each step, verify outcomes, and compile the Final Report]

---

## Notes

- **Always refine first:** Even simple requests benefit from clarification
- **Skip refinement only if:** The request is already precise with clear scope and intent
- All tools take a `request` parameter (string) — make it detailed and specific
- For verse references, use standard format: `Book Chapter:Verse` (e.g., `John 3:16`, `Gen 1:1-3`)
- Adjust steps based on complexity (simple = 3-4, complex = 5-7)
- Always include original language tools for exegetical questions
- The final report should **integrate** findings, not concatenate outputs
- If a tool returns thin results, **refine the input** and retry before moving on
